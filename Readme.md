Welcome to the Charlie Brown Memory Game! This is a two-player matching game. The objective of the game is to get more matches than your opponent. Each player takes their turn flipping over two cards. If the player finds a match, they one point, as well as getting to continue their turn. If the player does not get a match, then it will be the next players turn. At the ned of the game, once all cards are turn over, the point sof both players are tallied up. The player that has the most points at the end of the round is declared the winner. Thanks for checking out my game and I hope you enjoy it!
